In this project, I created a digital piano using the TM4C123 Launchpad, integrating GPIO I/O, Interrupts, Systick, and digital-to-analog conversion techniques. The piano features two modes: piano mode, where four buttons play notes C, D, E, and F with octave adjustment, and auto-play mode, which plays "Mary Had a Little Lamb," "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," and "Happy Birthday." I generated musical notes by creating square waves and adjusting their frequencies for different octaves. One challenge was developing the logic for switching between modes, which we resolved through iterative testing. This project was a rewarding experience, enhancing my understanding of music programming and embedded systems. Links to the demo videos and schematics are included in the repository.
